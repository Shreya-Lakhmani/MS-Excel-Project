VRINDA STORE WANTS TO CREATE AN ANNUAL SALES REPORT FOR 2022. SO THAT, VRINDA CAN UNDERSTAND THEIR CUSTOMERS AND GRO MORE SALES IN 2023.
QUESTIONS THAT I HAVE WORKED ON:

COMPARE THE SALES AND ORDERS USING SINGLE CHART!
WHICH MONTH GOT THE HIGHEST SALES AND ORDERS?
WHO PURCHASED MORE-MEN OR WOMEN IN 2022?
WHAT ARE DIFFERENT ORDER STATUS IN 2022?
LIST TOP 10 STATES CONTRIBUTING TO THE SALES?
RELATION BETWEEN AGE AND GENDER BASED ON NUMBER OF ORDERS?
WHICH CHANNEL IS CONTRIBUTING TO MAXIMUM SALES?
HIGHEST SELLING CATEGORY? ETC.

SAMPLE INSIGHTS

WOMEN ARE MORE LIKELY TO BUY COMPARED TO MEN(~65%).
MAHARASHTRA, KARNATAKA, AND UTTAR PRADESH ARE THE TOP 3.
ADULT AGE GROUP(30-49 YRS) IS MAX CONTRIBUTING (~50%).
AMAZON FLIPKART AND MYNTRA CHANNELS ARE MAX CONTRIBUTING(~80%).

FINAL CONCLUSIONS TO IMPROVE VRINDA STORE SALES:
TARGET WOMEN CUSTOMERS OF AGE GROUP (30-49 YRS) LIVING IN MAHARASHTRA, KARNATAKA AND UTTAR PRADESH BY SHOWING ADS/OFFERS/COUPONS AVAILABLE ON AMAZON, FLIPKART AND MYNTRA.
